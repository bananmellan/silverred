* Fedora Silverred
Is my attempt at making my own custom OCI based on Fedora Silverblue. The
container image is based on Fedora's own [[quay.io/fedora-ostree-desktops/silverblue][OSTree Desktop Images]], but the project
is /heavily/ inspired (or rather ripped off) from the [[https://universal-blue.org/][uBlue]] project, using their
[[https://github.com/ublue-os/main][main]], [[https://github.com/ublue-os/config][config]] and [[https://github.com/ublue-os/startingpoint][starting point]] repositories.
