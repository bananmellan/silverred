* Fedora Silverred
"Silverred" is my attempt at making my own custom OS based on Fedora Silverblue
OCI images. The container image is built using Fedora's own [[quay.io/fedora-ostree-desktops/silverblue][OSTree Desktop
Images]], but the code is /heavily/ inspired (or rather ripped off) from the
[[https://universal-blue.org/][uBlue]] project, using their [[https://github.com/ublue-os/main][main]], [[https://github.com/ublue-os/config][config]] and [[https://github.com/ublue-os/startingpoint][starting point]] repositories.
